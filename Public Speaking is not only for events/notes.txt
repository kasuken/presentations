Hello everyone and welcome to this session on public speaking. My name is Bing and I'm here to share with you some tips and tricks on how to deliver effective and engaging presentations.

Public speaking is a skill that can benefit you in many aspects of your life, whether it's for your career, your education, or your personal growth. It can help you communicate your ideas clearly, persuade your audience, and build your confidence.

But public speaking can also be challenging and intimidating for many people. You may feel nervous, anxious, or even fearful before or during a presentation. You may worry about forgetting your words, making mistakes, or losing the attention of your listeners.

So how can you overcome these challenges and become a better public speaker? Well, there is no magic formula or secret technique that can guarantee your success. But there are some principles and practices that can help you improve your skills and performance.

Today, I'm going to cover three main topics:

- How to prepare for a presentation
- How to structure and deliver your content
- How to handle questions and feedback

Let's start with the first topic: how to prepare for a presentation.







One of the most important aspects of public speaking is preparation. Preparation can make a huge difference in your confidence and performance. It can help you avoid common pitfalls such as running out of time, losing your train of thought, or boring your audience.

So how do you prepare for a presentation? Here are some steps you can follow:

- First, know your purpose and audience. Why are you giving this presentation? What do you want to achieve? Who are you speaking to? What are their interests, needs, and expectations? These questions can help you define your goal and tailor your message to your listeners.
- Second, research and organize your content. What are the main points you want to convey? What evidence or examples can you use to support them? How can you arrange them in a logical and coherent way? These questions can help you create an outline and a draft of your presentation.
- Third, practice and rehearse your presentation. How will you deliver your content? What words and phrases will you use? How will you use your voice, body language, and visual aids? How will you cope with nervousness or distractions? These questions can help you refine your delivery and anticipate potential challenges.
- Fourth, review and revise your presentation. How can you improve your content and delivery? What feedback can you get from others? How can you incorporate their suggestions or criticisms? These questions can help you polish your presentation and make it more effective and engaging.

By following these steps, you can prepare for a presentation that is clear, convincing, and captivating.





Now that we have covered how to prepare for a presentation, let's move on to the second topic: how to structure and deliver your content.

The structure and delivery of your content are crucial for the success of your presentation. They can help you capture and maintain the attention of your audience, convey your message clearly and persuasively, and create a lasting impression.

So how do you structure and deliver your content? Here are some tips you can follow:

- First, start with a strong introduction. The introduction is your chance to hook your audience and make them interested in your topic. You can use various techniques to start your presentation, such as telling a story, asking a question, sharing a statistic, or making a bold statement. The introduction should also include your main goal and a brief overview of your main points.
- Second, develop your main points in the body. The body is where you present your arguments, evidence, and examples to support your goal. You should have no more than three to five main points, each with a clear topic sentence, supporting details, and a transition to the next point. You should also use signposts and summaries to help your audience follow your logic and remember your key points.
- Third, end with a memorable conclusion. The conclusion is your chance to reinforce your message and motivate your audience to take action. You can use various techniques to end your presentation, such as repeating your main points, giving a call to action, offering a solution, or leaving a question. The conclusion should also include a thank you and an invitation for questions or feedback.

By following these tips, you can structure and deliver your content in a way that is clear, convincing, and captivating.







We have covered how to prepare for a presentation and how to structure and deliver your content. Now let's move on to the third and final topic: how to handle questions and feedback.

Questions and feedback are an essential part of any presentation. They can help you clarify your message, address any doubts or objections, and build rapport with your audience.

So how do you handle questions and feedback? Here are some dos and don'ts you can follow:

- Do invite questions and feedback at the end of your presentation. You can say something like "Thank you for your attention. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have." or "I appreciate your feedback. Do you have any comments or suggestions?"
- Don't ignore or dismiss questions and feedback. You should acknowledge and thank your audience for their input, even if you disagree or don't know the answer. You can say something like "That's a good question. Thank you for asking." or "That's an interesting comment. Thank you for sharing."
- Do listen carefully and respond clearly. You should pay attention to what your audience is saying and try to understand their perspective. You should also answer their questions or address their feedback in a clear and concise way. You can say something like "To answer your question, ..." or "To respond to your comment, ..."
- Don't ramble or get defensive. You should avoid giving long or irrelevant answers or getting into arguments with your audience. You should also avoid using filler words, such as "um", "uh", or "like". You can say something like "I hope that answers your question." or "I respect your opinion."
- Do end on a positive note. You should thank your audience again for their participation and interest. You should also restate your main message and goal. You can say something like "Thank you again for your questions and feedback. I hope you enjoyed this presentation and learned something new about public speaking."

By following these dos and don'ts, you can handle questions and feedback in a way that is respectful, professional, and effective.
