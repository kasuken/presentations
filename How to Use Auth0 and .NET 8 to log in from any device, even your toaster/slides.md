## Technical Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

- You need to have a registered application with Auth0 and configure its settings
- You need to have a registered API with Auth0 and enable offline access if you want to use refresh tokens
- You need to have a C# development environment and install RestSharp library
- You need to have an internet connection and a browser

---

## What is Auth0? üîê

- Auth0 is a platform that provides authentication and authorization as a service
- Auth0 allows you to easily integrate various identity providers and protocols into your applications
- Auth0 also offers features such as user management, multifactor authentication, single sign-on, and more

## What is Device Flow Authentication? üì±

- Device Flow Authentication is a variant of the OAuth 2.0 protocol that enables input-constrained devices to obtain an access token
- Device Flow Authentication involves two different paths: one on the device requesting authorization and one on the user's browser
- Device Flow Authentication requires the device app to pass along its Client ID to initiate the authorization process and get a device code and a user code

## How to Implement Device Flow Authentication with Auth0 üíª

- Register your application with Auth0 and configure its settings
- Request a device code from the Auth0 Authorization Server using your Client ID
- Display the device code, user code, and verification URI to the user
- Poll the Auth0 Authorization Server for an access token using the device code
- Ask the user to visit the verification URI on their browser and enter the user code
- Redirect the user to the login and consent prompt, if needed
- Respond with an access token (and optionally, a refresh token) when the user authorizes the device
- Use the access token to call your API
- Use the refresh token to request new tokens when the existing ones expire

---

## Code Examples üìù

### Request a device code

```csharp
// Using RestSharp library
var client = new RestClient("https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/oauth/device/code");
var request = new RestRequest(Method.POST);
request.AddParameter("client_id", "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>");
request.AddParameter("scope", "<YOUR_SCOPES>");
request.AddParameter("audience", "<YOUR_API_AUDIENCE>");
IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);
// Parse response.Content for device_code, user_code, verification_uri
// Display them to the user
```

### Poll for an access token

```csharp
// Using RestSharp library
var client = new RestClient("https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/oauth/token");
var request = new RestRequest(Method.POST);
request.AddParameter("grant_type", "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code");
request.AddParameter("client_id", "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>");
request.AddParameter("device_code", "<YOUR_DEVICE_CODE>");
IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);
// Parse response.Content for access_token and refresh_token
// Use access_token to call your API
// Store refresh_token for later use
```

### Request new tokens with a refresh token

```csharp
// Using RestSharp library
var client = new RestClient("https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/oauth/token");
var request = new RestRequest(Method.POST);
request.AddParameter("grant_type", "refresh_token");
request.AddParameter("client_id", "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>");
request.AddParameter("refresh_token", "<YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN>");
IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);
// Parse response.Content for access_token and refresh_token
// Use access_token to call your API
// Store refresh_token for later use
```

## Benefits of Device Flow Authentication with Auth0 üéÅ

- You can provide a secure and seamless authentication experience for your users on input-constrained devices
- You can leverage Auth0's features such as social login, multifactor authentication, single sign-on, and more
- You can customize the device code settings, such as character set, format, and length
- You can monitor and troubleshoot your device flow authentication using Auth0's logs and dashboard
